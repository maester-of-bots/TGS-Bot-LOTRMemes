[fiercely]  Is that its name?
[icily]  Where are you leading them?
[to Frodo]  Where will you go to reach there, Frodo?
Answer me!
Cirith Ungol?

What did they steal?
[fiercely] Is that its name?
[icily] Where are you leading them?
[solemn] You are a friend of Boromir?

[to Frodo] Where will you go to reach there, Frodo?
And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.
Answer me!
As one of his companions, I had hope you would tell me. He was my brother.
Cirith Ungol?
Good speech. Nice and short.
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is... where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace. War will make corpses of us all.

It would grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Speak!
That's enough.
The enemy?

There are no travelers in this land... only servants of the Dark Lord.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
What did they steal?
What did they steal?
Your bodyguard?
