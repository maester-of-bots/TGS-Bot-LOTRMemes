The shards of Narsil ... the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.

Still sharp.  But no more than a broken heirloom.

So it is true!

Isildur’s Bane.

It is a gift ... a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay ... by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy ... let us use it against him!

And what would a Ranger know of this matter?

Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?

Gondor has no king.

One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire, and ash and dust ... the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand Men could you do this. It is folly.

And what if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?

You carry the fates of us all, little one.

If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done.

Get away from the blade, Pippin ... on your toes ... good, very good ... I want you to react, not think.

It’s moving fast … against the wind.

It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing ... such a little thing.

As you wish. I care not.

We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city!

This is no mine ... It's a tomb!

We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.

They have a cave-troll!

What is this new devilry?

Give them a moment ... for pity's sake!

Gandalf's death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead.

I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me, “Even now, there is hope left.” But I cannot see it ... it is long since we had any hope.

My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing, and our ... our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right ... and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze ... have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

One day, our paths will lead us there, and the tower guard will take up the call “the Lords of Gondor have returned.”

Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

You were quick enough to trust the Elves.

Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that.

You are afraid!

All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

Scared of who you are, of what you are.

None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you ... Frodo?

I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Let me help you. There are other ways, Frodo ... other paths that we might take.

Warning? Against what?

We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have ... don't you see that is madness?

I ask only for the strength to defend my people. If you would but lend me the Ring…

Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end.

You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine! It should be mine! Give it to me! Give me the Ring.

I see your mind ... you will take the Ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all your Halflings!

Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please, Frodo...

I’m sorry, Frodo … Frodo…

Run! Run!

They took the little ones...Frodo ... where is Frodo?

Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.

Forgive me. I did not see ... I have failed you all.

Leave it! It is over ... the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin ... Aragorn...


I would have followed you, my brother ... my captain, my king.

This city was once the jewel of our kingdom ... a place of light and beauty and music ... and so it shall be once more!

Let the armies of Mordor know this: never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

Leaves more time for drinking!

Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good.

One moment of peace, can he not give us that?


They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

You give him no credit, and yet he tries do to your will.

He loves you, Father.

The One Ring ... Isildur’s Bane.


No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell!

Remember today, little brother.
