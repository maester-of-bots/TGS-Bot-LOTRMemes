Alright then, keep your secrets!
And it is also said, 'Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.'
Because we've been here before. We're going in circles!
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of. Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
Come on, u/{}. Remember what Bilbo used to say: "It's a dangerous business, Frodo. Going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."
Do not be too sad, u/{}. You cannot always be torn in two
Frodo wouldn't have got far without u/{}, would he?
I am naked in the dark, u/{}, and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire.
I can manage it. I must.
I cannot go back
I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else. Off with you, on one of your adventures.
I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me.
I will take ring... though, I do not know the way
I wish it need not have happened in my time
I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring
I'm glad to be with you, u/{}, here at the end of all things.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance!
Mordor, u/{}, is it left, or right?
Nothing. There's nothing. Wait. There are markings. It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.
Then I know what I must do. It's just... I'm afraid to do it
There is no real going back.
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Who is she? This woman you sing of?
You swore! You swore on the precious! u/{} promised!
You're late!
