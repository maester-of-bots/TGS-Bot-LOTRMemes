All right. We don’t have that much left. We have to be careful or we’re going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mister u/{}. I’ve rationed it. There should be enough
Back you devils!
But you’re not. I’m here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would.
Captain u/{}.  You have shown your quality, sir. The very highest.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? Do you want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
Don’t you let go! Don’t let go. Reach!
Everywhere I lie there’s a dirty, great root stickin’ into my back.
Get off of me! Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot! Get off of me!
Give me your hand!...Take my hand!
Heh!... Mr. Frodo is not goin’ anywhere without me!
Hey stinker, don’t go getting too far ahead.
Hey, what’s in this tunnel?...You listen to me, and you listen good and proper. Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. One sniff something’s not right, one hair stands up on the back of my head, it’s over. No more slinker. No more stinker. You’re gone. Got it? I’m watching you.
I bet they don’t mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them:"The finest rockets ever seen. They burst in stars of blue and green. Or after thunder, silver showers…Came falling like a…rain of flowers”. Oh, that doesn’t do them justice by a long road.
I don’t care! I can’t do it, Mister u/{}; I won’t wait around for him to kill us.
I have been droppin’ no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me.
I take one more step, it’ll be the farthest away from home I’ve ever been.
I think I’m getting the hang of this.
I wonder if people will ever say, “Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring.” And they’ll say, “Yes! That’s one of my favorite stories.” “Frodo was really courageous, wasn’t he, Dad?” “Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that’s saying a lot.”
It’s me. It’s your Sam. Don’t you know your Sam?
Let him go! Or I’ll have you, Longshanks!
Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo. We’re lost. I don’t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-Earth we don’t want to see any closer is the one place we’re trying to get to, and just where we can’t get.
Mr. Frodo!...Get back you! Don’t touch him!
Mr. Frodo, are you all right?
Mr. Frodo? Frodo! Frodo!
Mr. Frodo? It’s the ring, isn’t it?
Mr. Frodo?...He’s going cold!
N-n-n-nothing important. That is I heard a good deal about a Ring and a Dark Lord and something about the end of the world but… Please, Mister Gandalf sir, don’t hurt me. Don’t turn me into anythin’…. unnatural.
Not before Mister Frodo’s had somethin’ to eat.
Now there’s an eye opener, and no mistake.
Oh save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Oh, my– I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it to go so far. I was just so– so angry. Here, just— Let’s just rest a bit.
Oh, no. I’m not hungry. Leastways not for lembas bread.
Po-ta-toes!... Boil ‘em, mash ‘em, stick ‘em up your ass
Po-tay-toes! Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew
Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would’ve been her. It would’ve been her.
Samwise, you fool!
Shhh! Stop it! Be quiet!
So there’s no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you understand? He’s got to destroy it! That’s where we’re going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!...Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not help him?
Thank you, my lady. Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
That fellow’s done nothin’ but stare at you since we arrived.
Then let us be rid of it, once and for all! Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!!!
Ugh. What is that horrid stink?...I wonder if there’s a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
Wait! We’re innocent travelers!
We are six days from Rivendell. He’ll never make it!
We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear
We were that worried about you, weren’t we, Mr. Gandalf?
We’re going that way. Straight as we can. There’s no point carrying anything we’re not sure to need.
What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there!
What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat on ‘em.
Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
You don’t mean that. You can’t leave.
You had a whole half already!
You’ll make him sick, you will. Behavin’ like that. There’s only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
you’re a lying rat! What did you do with it!?
You’ve been into Farmer Maggot’s crop!
