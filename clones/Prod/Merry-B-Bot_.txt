...It's been going for hours.
...My lady!
Are you going to leave me?
Are you mad? We will be caught for sure.
But it's night time already! You can't take forever!
But you're part of this world, aren't you?... You must help... please.
Can't say that I have. You, u/{}?
Death!
Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the Ring. He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
'Dunno why he is so upset. It's only a couple of carrots!
Excuse me? I have a sword. Please accept it.  I offer you my service, Theoden King.
How can that be your decision?
I don't know. I don't know what is going to happen.
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, u/{}
I think I've broken something.
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
Mm. Green Dragon.
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.
Pippin, everyone knows *I'm* the tall one. *You're* the short one.
Right... Buckleberry Ferry! Follow me!
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
That black rider was looking for something. Or someone. Frodo?
The fires of Isengard will spread, and the forests of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once great and good in this world will be gone. There won't *be* a Shire, u/{}.
Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!
We're running out of time!
We're under orders from Treebeard, who has taken over management of Isengard.
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?
What? That was just a detour, a shortcut.
Why are there so few of you, when you live so long? Are there Ent children?
Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?
Yes Pippin! My point is, he is clearly overreactin'. Run!
You just said something... treeish!
You're taller.
