A red sun rises.  Blood has been spilled this night.
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near, I can feel it.
AI AI A BALROG HAS COME
And my bow.
Aragorn!
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
Aragorn, nedin dagor hen Ãº'erir ortheri. Natha daged dhaer.
Argh! A scout!
Come on!
Crebain from Dunland!
Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman.
Forty-three.
Govannas vin gwennen le, Haldir o Lorien.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed.
He was twitching.
I feel something. A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it's affecting me.
I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near.
I'm on 17, what about you u/{}?
Nineteen!
one bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
Or too few. Look at them. They're frightened. I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hyn neled herain dan caer menig.
Orcs!
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?
That is no Orc horn.
That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice. The eye of the enemy is moving.
The Uruks turn northeast. They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!
There is a  fell voice on the air
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
THEY'RE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO ISENGARD!
They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!
This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn son of Arathorn. An heir to the throne of Gondor, You owe him your allegiance.
This is old, very old. Full of memory, and anger.
We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
What about side by side with a friend?
You lie!
You look terrible.
You would die before your stroke fell!
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
