What Grace is given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him.
And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone.
Do you remember when we first met?
Frodo? Frodo, no!  Frodo, don't give in! Not now!
I choose a mortal life.
If you want him, come and claim him!
It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart.
Long years have passed. You did not have the cares you carry now. Do you remember what I told you?
Nîn o Chithaeglir lasto beth daer; Rimmo nîn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
What's this? A Ranger, caught off his guard?
Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.
Your time will come. You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it.
