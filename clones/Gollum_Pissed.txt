Go away?
...So juicy sweet!
[Alter Ego Gollum pets Sméagol on the shoulder]  Sméagol... Why does it cry, Sméagol?
[appalled]  What?
[coughing up a biscuit that Frodo gives him]  It tries to choke us!
[crying in defeat]  EEEEYAHHHHHHH!
[despairingly]  That would kill us! KILL US!
[flopping on his back and withers on the ground as he groans]  Oooooohhhhaaahhhh...
[gasps fearfully and scrambles away; climbing on top of a boulder] 
[Gollum lets out a high-pitched noise as Sam's jerking on the rope chokes him and throws him on to the ground] 
[Gollum sits up and gasps in air greedily, clutching his throat] 
[grabbing hold of a nearby rock with one hand and pulls the rope back with his other hand]  Nasty elves twisted it! TAKE IT OFF US!
[horrified shout]  NO!
[horrified]  NO! That would kill us! KILL US!
[impatiently]  No time to lose, silly!
[in a panic]  Not that way! Oh! What's he doing?
[in a pitiful squawk of a voice]  Y-YES!
[looking away; morosely]  Mustn't ask us, not it's business. Gollum, gollum.
[looks up at Frodo; genuinely surprised]  What did you call me?
[narrating cont.; Closeup on Smeagol's mouth, which is full of tooth decay and hunger-induced drool]  And all we wished was to catch fish...
[narrating cont.; scene shows a balding, pale and rapidly thin Smeagol crying, rocking with sorrow in the rain]  And we wept precious... We wept to be so alone...
[narrating]  They cursed us. Murderer they called us. They cursed us, and drove us away...
[nods; still timid]  Yes.
[of Sauron]  He is drawing all evil to him.
[overcome with emotion]  My name...
[shaking his head vigorously; yowling like a cat]  No, no!
[singing]  Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? Caught in a web. Soon you'll be... eaten.
[singing]  The rock and pool, is nice and cool, so juicy sweet. Our only wish,
[sinister whisper]  *Murderer*.
[Sméagol is sobbing]  Sméagol... Why does he cry, Sméagol?
[snarling malevolently]  Yes, precious, false! They will cheat you, hurt you, LIE.
[timidly]  Yes...
[to Frodo and Sam]  We be nice to them, if they be nice to us.
[to Frodo]  Don't follow the lights.
[to Frodo]  It was tricksy, precious. Very tricksy.
[to himself]  So bright... so beautiful... ah, Precious.
[to Sam]  Nasty elves twisted it! Take it off us!
[to Sam]  Stupid, fat hobbit.
[wailing dramatically]  We shall *STARRRRRVVVVVEEE!*
[wailing piteously]  Aghh! It burns! It burns us... It freezes...
[wailing]  It BURNS! It Burns us!
[wistful]  Sme... Smeagol.
Agggghhhhhhahhhh...
All dead... all rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle, long ago. The Dead Marshes... yes, that is their name.
But, the fat Hobbit. He knows. Eyes always watching.
Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travelers far from home.
Come on! We must go, no time!
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
Filthy little hobbites. They stole it from us.
Filthy little hobbitses! They stole it from us!
Follow me.
For us.
He wants the Precious. Always he is looking for it. And the Precious is wanting to go back to him... But we mustn't let him have it.
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit, who hates Sméagol, and who makes up nasty lies!
I found it, I did. A way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come Hobbitses, soft and quick as shadows we must be.
It freezes...
It's the only way. Go in, or go back.
Kill them both.
Look. What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it! He took it! I seen him!
Master betrayed us!
Master betrayed us.
Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy, False. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
Master broke his promise.
Master must go inside the tunnel.
Master should be resting, Master needs to keep up his strength.
Myyy PRECIOUSSS.
Myyyy... Precious!
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
No crunchable birdses!
No time to lose, silly.
No!
No! No! Master!
No. Not very nice at all, my love.
No... No birdses to eat.
Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
Of course, he did. I told you he was tricksy, I told you he was false.
Oh yes we could. Spoilin' nice fish. Give it to us raw and w-r-r-riggling; you keep nasty chips.
Oh! Cruel Hobbit! It does not care if we be hungry. It does not care if we should die! Not like Master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes, Precious...
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
See? See? He wants it for himself!
She's always hungry. She always needs to feed. She must eat. All she gets is nasty Orcses.
Smeagol? No, no, Not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty elf bread.
Sneaking.
Sneaking.
Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret way that nobody else could find. And they say sneak! Sneak? Very nice, friend... Oh, yes. My precious. Very nice...

Sneaky little Hobbitses.
so juicy sweet.
Take this off us.
Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses, make him crawl.
They cursed us. Murderer they called us. They cursed us, and drove us away. And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so alone. And we only wish to catch fish so juicy sweet. And we forgot the taste of bread... the sound of trees... the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My Precious.
They do not see what lies ahead, when Sun has faded and Moon is dead.
to catch a fish,
To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, sleepies. We must go, yeeees, we must go at once.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, sleepies. We must go, yeeees, we must go at once.
We could let *her* do it.
We must go.
We soon forgot the taste of bread, the sound of wind in the trees... We even forgot our name...
We swears to serve the master of the Precious. We will swear on... on... the Precious!
We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!
We'll be nice to them, if they be nice to us.
We'll be nice to them, if they be nice to us. Take this off of us... We swear to do whatever you wants... we swear.
We're not *in* decent places.
What did you say?
What's taters, precious? What's taters, eh?
Where would you be without me, uh? gollum, gollum... *I* saved us! It was me! *We* survived because of *me*!
Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.
Yes! Precious! Precious... Precious!
Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.
You don't have any friends; nobody likes you!
You're a liar and a thief.
Go away?
