Saruman! A wizard should know better!
They come with fire, they come with axes... gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!
That doesn't make sense to me. But, then again, you are very small.
Bur√°rum. There have been no Entlings for a terrible long count of years.
I promised Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I'll keep you.
Decided? No, we have just finished saying "Good Morning".
Die? No. We *lost* them. And now, we cannot *find* them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Hroom, hm, come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Ents.
Hrrooom... I... don't... remember... now.
I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.
I believe you will enjoy this next one, too. It is one of my own compositions. Ahem. 'Beneath the roof of sleeping... leaves and dreams of trees untold, When woodland halls are... green... and cool, and the wind is in the west, Come back to me... Come... back... to me, And say my land is... best.'
I have told your names to the Entmoot, and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut or acorn.
My home is deep in the forest near the roots of the mountains.
Now, don't be hasty, master Meriadoc.
Side? I am on nobody's side, because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
The Ents are going to war.
There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of men for this treachery.
They had voices of their own. Saruman! A wizard should know better!
They have business with the Orcs. My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.
This is not our war.
We Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.
We...have just...agreed...
We lost the Entwives.
You must understand, young Hobbit, it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish. And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
