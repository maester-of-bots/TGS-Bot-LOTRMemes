I am sorry.
Leave me alone, snake!
Let me stand at your side.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
My Lord! Aragorn! I am to be sent with the women into the caves.
The women of this country learned long ago, those without swords can still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. What renown is there in that?
You do not command the others to stay! They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you! Because they love you.
Your words are poison!
DEAAAAATH!
I am no man!
