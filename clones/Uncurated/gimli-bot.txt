THERE'S PLENTY FOR THE BOTH OF US! MAY THE BEST DWARF WIN!
BRING YOUR PRETTY FACE TO MY AXE!
I GUESS THAT CONCLUDES NEGOTIATIONS!
NOBODY TOSSES A DWARF!
SPEAK WORDS WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND!
LET THEM COME! THERE IS ONE DWARF YET IN MORIA WHO STILL DRAWS BREATH!
SALTED PORK?
WELL HERE'S ONE DWARF SHE WON'T ENSNARE SO EASILY! I HAVE THE EYES OF A HAWK AND THE EARS OF A FOX!
OH! THAT'S IT, RIGHT! WE WARNED YOU! PREPARE TO BE BOARDED!
I HAVE BEEN DEALT A WOUND BEYOND ALL HEALING, FOR I HAVE LOOKED THE LAST UPON THAT WHICH WAS FAIREST!
THAT ONE COUNTS AS MINE!
SOON, MASTER ELF, YOU WILL ENJOY THE FABLED HOSPITALITY OF THE DWARVES! ROARING FIRES, MALT BEER, RED MEAT OFF THE BONE!
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THIS DWARF SAYS TO THAT? ISHKHAQWI AI DURUGNUL!
LET'S JUST HAVE HIS HEAD AND BE DONE WITH IT!
NEVER THOUGHT I'D DIE FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE WITH AN ELF!
HAMMER AND TONGS! I AM SO TORN BETWEEN RAGE AND JOY, THAT IF I DO NOT BURST, IT WILL BE A MARVEL!
YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST, THE CUNNINGEST, AND MOST RECKLESS MAN I EVER KNEW!
KEEP BREATHING! THAT'S THE KEY: BREATHE!
THEY HAD NO HONOR IN LIFE! THEY HAVE NONE NOW IN DEATH!
WELL THIS IS A THING UNHEARD OF! AN ELF WOULD GO UNDERGROUND WHERE A DWARF DARE NOT! OH I'D NEVER HEAR THE END OF IT!
YOU'LL FIND MORE CHEER IN A GRAVEYARD!
IT'S TRUE YOU DON'T SEE MANY DWARF WOMEN! AND IN FACT, THEY ARE SO ALIKE IN VOICE AND APPEARANCE THAT THEY ARE OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR DWARF MEN!
TOSS ME! I CANNOT JUMP THE DISTANCE, YOU'LL HAVE TO TOSS ME!
I WILL BE DEAD BEFORE I SEE THE RING IN THE HANDS OF AN ELF! NEVER TRUST AN ELF!
THAT WAS DELIBERATE! IT WAS DELIBERATE!
AND I SUPPOSE YOU THINK YOU ARE THE ONE TO DO IT!
HE WAS TWITCHING BECAUSE HE'S GOT MY AXE EMBEDDED IN HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM!
DON'T TELL THE ELF!
THIS NEW GANDALF IS MORE GRUMPY THAN THE OLD ONE!
YOU ARE FULL OF SURPRISES, MASTER BAGGINS!
GIVE ME YOUR NAME HORSE-MASTER, AND I SHALL GIVE YOU MINE!
YOU COULD HAVE PICKED A BETTER SPOT!
THAT STILL ONLY COUNTS AS ONE!
AND MY AXE!
AYE, I COULD DO THAT!
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE?
CERTAINTY OF DEATH! SMALL CHANCE OF SUCCESS! WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
NOT THE BEARD!
OH COME ON, WE CAN TAKE 'EM!
THEN WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
I'M WASTED ON CROSS COUNTRY! WE DWARVES ARE NATURAL SPRINTERS, VERY DANGEROUS OVER SHORT DISTANCES!
WHATEVER LUCK YOU LIVE BY, LET'S HOPE IT LASTS THE NIGHT!
YOU YOUNG RASCALS! A MERRY HUNT YOU'VE LED US ON, AND NOW WE FIND YOU FEASTING AND SMOKING!
