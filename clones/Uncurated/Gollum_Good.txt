...and take it for ME.
[a black rider is flying over Sam, Frodo and Smeagol's hiding place; startled]  Ah-uh-uh? AHHHHH!
[closes his ears with his hands]  I'm not listening... I'm not listening...
[cowering away from Gollum]  No! Nobody's business! Leave us alone!
[cries fearfully]  Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
[crying]  No... NO!
[looks around; then begins galumphing around with joy]  We told him to go away... and away he goes, Precious! Gone, gone, gone! SMEAGOL IS FREE!
[louder and firmer]  Leave now, and never come back!
[mocking]  Oo-hoo-hoo-hoo...
[shaking his head]  No. Not master!
[stops crying]  Not anymore.
[throaty cough; his voice slowly becoming guttural]  Gollum... Gollum... Gollum!
[voice breaking; hurt by Gollum's remark]  Go away!
[weeping and wimpering; to Gollum]  Go away! I hate you... I hate you...
[weeping]  I hate you. I *hate* you.
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?
Because it's my birthday, and I wants it.
But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
Clever Hobbits, to climb so high!
Come on Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smeagol will show the way.
Cruel men hurts us. Master tricks us.
Cruel men hurts us. Master tricksed us.
Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.
Give us that, Deagol my love.
Leave now, and never come back!
LEAVE! NOW! AND NEVER COME BACK!
Master is my friend.
Master is our friend, our friend.
Master is our friend... our friend.
Master looks after us now. We don't need you anymore.
Master. Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us.
Mustn't go that way! Mustn't hurt the Precious!
My precious...
Naughty little fly, Why does it cry, Caught in a web, Soon to be... eaten!
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
No, not it's business. Leave us alone.
No.
No... No.
Once they're dead. Shh.
OOHH-WHHHHAAAAAAHHHHH! Oh!
OOOH-AAAHHH! AhHAAAAA! AAHHHH!
OW-Whaaa! Oh!
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.
Smeagol lied.
The precious will be ours... once the Hobbitses are dead!
Yes, we... we meant for us.
Yes. No! No! It's too risky. It's too risky.
Yes. She could do it.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
