Radagast : I'll draw them off.

Gandalf : These are Gundabad wargs. They will outrun you!

Radagast : These are Rhosgobel rabbits. I'd like to see them try.

Radagast : A dark power has found its way back into the world.

Radagast : The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A darkness has fallen over it. Nothing grows anymore, at least nothing good. The air is fouled decay, but worst are the webs.

Gandalf : Webs? What do you mean?

Radagast : Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant or I'm not a wizard. I followed their trail, they came from... Dol Guldur.

Gandalf : Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is abandoned.

Radagast : No, Gandalf, 'tis not. A dark power dwells in there. Such as I have never felt before. It is the shadow of an ancient horror. One that can summon the spirits of the dead. I saw him, Gandalf, from out of the darkness. A Necromancer has come!

Necromancer : [whispers in an unknown language] 

[Radagast endeavors to cure an ailing hedgehog] 

Radagast : I don't understand why it's not working! It's not as if it's witchcraft!

[pause] 

Radagast : Witchcraft... Oh, but it IS. A dark and terrible magic...

Radagast : [shows Gandalf a Morgul-blade]  That thing is not from the world of the living...
