*What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.*
All riders to the head of the column!
And Rohan will answer! Muster the Rohirrim! Assemble the Men at Dunharrow. As many Men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor and war!
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
As long as you can give me
DEEEEAAATTTHH!!!!!
Éomer, take your éored down the left flank. Gamling, follow the King’s banner down the center. u/{}, take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness! Arise, Arise, Riders of Théoden! Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered, a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!  Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin, and the world’s ending! Death! Death! Death! Forth Eorlingas!!!
Fell deeds, awake... Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red dawn... Forth Eorlingas!
For death and glory.
Get the women and children into the caves.
Get them into the caves. u/{}'s arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here
Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon–? No, my Lord u/{}, we are alone.
Hahahahaahaha. Hahahahahahah. You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey.
He leaves because he must.
I am happy for you. He is an honorable man.
I am ready u/{}. Bring my horse...This is not a defeat...We will return...We will return.
I know your face. Éowyn. Éowyn. Gandalf?
I know your face…Éowyn.
I take my leave.
I will say no more.
Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
Make haste. We ride through the night.
Make safe the city!
My eyes darken.
Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
Ride! Ride now to Gondor!
She watched her mother succumb to grief. Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I’d hoped for.
So it begins...
So much death. What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!
Tell me; why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?
There is no time. War is upon us.
Time is against us. Make ready!
u/{},  you need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a Man of Rohan. Come down.
Victory! We have victory!
We shall have peace. We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows, we shall have peace.
When I last looked, Théoden, not u/{}, was King of Rohan.
Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West, behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?
Where is Théodred? Where is my son?
Who am I, Gamling?
Why should I welcome you, u/{} Stormcrow?
Yes. Yes. The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
You must lead the people to Helm’s Deep, and make haste.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
