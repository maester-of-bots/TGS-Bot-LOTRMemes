All Isengard is emptied.
Are you frightened?
Be at peace son of Gondor.
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us!
FOR FRODO!!
FOR MY PART I FORGIVE YOUR DOUBT. LITTLE DO I RESEMBLE THE FIGURES OF ELENDIL AND ISILDUR AS THEY STAND CARVEN IN THIER MAJESTY IN THE HALLS OF DENETHOR. I AM BUT A HEIR OF ISILDUR, NOT ISILDUR HIMSELF. I HAVE HAD A HARD LIFE AND AND A LONG; AND THE LEAGUES THAT LIE BETWEEN HERE AND GONDOR ARE A SMALL PART IN THE COUNT OF MY JOURNEYS. I HAVE CROSSED MANY MOUNTAINS AND MANY RIVERS AND TRODDEN MANY PLAINS EVER INTO THE FAR COUNTRIES OF RHUN AND HARAD WHERE WHERE THE STARS ARE STRANGE!
Gentlemen, we do not stop til nightfal
Gondor will answer.
HACEKOMAE,  the Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old... My kin
He is passing into the Shadow World. He'll soon become a wraith like them.
He’s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm’s Deep has saved them in the past.
He's not alone. Sam went with him.
HES TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN! GANDALF WE MUST TURN BACK!
Hold your ground, hold your ground. Sons of Gondor, of Rohan my brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down but it is not this day. This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth I bid you stand, Men of the West!
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
I do not believe it! I will not!
I have seen the White City, long ago
I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace.
I let Frodo go.
I swore to protect you.
I will not let the White city fall nor our people fail
I would have gone with you to the end into the very fires of Mordor.
I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end.
If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword.
Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish, but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way?
It is an army bred for a single purpose, to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek
It will not be our end, but his.
Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun’s ear.
Let the lord of the Black Lands come forth, that justice be done upon him!
No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time... And safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.
Not a word.
Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron’s Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves.
Open war is upon you, whether you risk it or not
'Strider' I am to one fat man who lives within a day's march of foes that would freeze his heart, or lay his little town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly.
THE BEACONS OF MINAS TIRITH! THE BEACONS ARE LIT! GONDOR CALLS FOR AID!
The mines are no place for a pony, even one so brave as Bill.
Then I shall die as one of them!
There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets it's will against us
They have a better chance defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They will be small, only children to your eyes
Tis the lay of Luthien. The elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren a mortal!
Tracks lead away from the battle, into...Fangorn Forest.
u/{},  the Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old... My kin
u/{}, you have my sword
What do you fear my lady?
Why have you come?
Will you ride with us?
You fell!
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Éomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
You have my sword
You have some skill with a blade.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it.
You said you'd bind yourself to me, forsaking the immortal life of your people.
You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
You will suffer me
