*Get out, you old wight! Vanish in the sunlight! Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, out into the barren 
	lands far beyond the mountains! Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty! Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness, 
	Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.*

He's mine. My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When 
	your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him.

Eldest, that's what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the 
	first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here 
	before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the 
	seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless â€“ before the Dark Lord came from Outside.

What? Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! 
	I'll freeze his marrow cold, if he don't behave himself. I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and 
	branch away. Old Man Willow!

Eldest, that's what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the 
	first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here 
	before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the 
	seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless â€“ before the Dark Lord came from Outside.
