We had to throw rocks. I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn't want her anymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she'd have deer to hunt. Only she kept following and finally we had to throw rocks. I hit her twice. She whined and looked at me and I felt so 'shamed, but it was right, wasn't it? The queen would have killed her.

Can't wait to hear what Bobby B has to say about this!
Someday I'm going to put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.
Not if they lose their heads first.
I can't sleep until I say the names.

Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.
